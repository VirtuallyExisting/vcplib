# vcplib (Virtually Cross Platform Library)
Library for making games across Nintendo Wii, 3DS, and DS

**Currently supported platforms:**
- None (Library still in progress)

## What is vcplib?
vcplib is a library attempting to use OTHER libraries to make cross-platform games easier across Wii, 3DS, and DS.

vcplib is not finished (at all) and I am still working on it, vcplib could become even easier to use than the libraries IT uses.

## What does vcplib use under the hood?

- 3DS: libctru and citro2d
- Wii: libogc and GRRLIB
- DS: libnds
